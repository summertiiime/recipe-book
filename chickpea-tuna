Ingredients
    1 can (14 oz) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
    1/4 cup of vegan mayo (or 3 – 4 tablespoons hummus + 2 – 3 tablespoons water)

    1/4 cup celery (about 2 small stalks, leaves ok too), chopped
    1/4 cup red onion (about 1/2 small), chopped
    10 capers
    1 crushed nori sheet, optional (for additional ocean-y flavor)
    
    1 tablespoon chia seeds or hemp hearts, optional (for some omega 3 & 6)
    1 tbsp nutritional yeast

    1 tbsp lemon juice 
    1 tbsp tamari or soy sauce
    1/2 tsp white or rice vinegar, optional
    1/2 tbsp dijon mustard

    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    sea salt & cracked pepper, to taste
    dash of cayenne, optional
   

Instructions

1. Mash chickpeas: Drain and rinse chickpeas, place in a medium-size bowl, and roughly mash with the back of a fork or potato masher until desired consistency.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well

Alternatively, you can use a food processor to start with the beans, pulse a few times, and add the remaining ingredients, pulsing again a few times until the desired consistency.

Serve chilled or at room temperature.
